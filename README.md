# Dashboard

Digital dashboards allow managers to monitor the contribution of the various departments in their organization. To gauge exactly how well an organization is performing overall, digital dashboards allow you to capture and report specific data points from each department within the organization, thus providing a "snapshot" of performance.

Benefits of using digital dashboards include:

Visual presentation of performance measures
Ability to identify and correct negative trends
Measure efficiencies/inefficiencies
Ability to generate detailed reports showing new trends
Ability to make more informed decisions based on collected business intelligence
Align strategies and organizational goals
Saves time compared to running multiple reports
Gain total visibility of all systems instantly
Quick identification of data outliers and correlations
